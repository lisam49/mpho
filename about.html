    <h2>My Interests</h2>
    <p>
      I have a strong passion for content creation, cooking, and baking. These hobbies allow me to express my creativity, explore new ideas, and share joy with others. When I’m not attending lectures or studying, I’m often active on the netball court, where I enjoy the teamwork and energy of the game.
